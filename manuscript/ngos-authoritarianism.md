In April 2018, the Chinese Ministry of State Security published a pamphlet in conjunction with the country’s third annual National Security Education Day. This 8-panel comic (see excerpt in @fig:comic) tells the story of a suspicious white NGO worker who collaborates with Chinese labor activists to spread Western notions of labor rights. The Westerner begins by recruiting potential Chinese collaborators and then works with his newfound counterparts to offer workshops and trainings to local workers. After instilling Western ideas of labor unions, Chinese workers take to the streets in strikes, overseen by the Western NGO worker who excitedly promises to pay his Chinese counterpart for the successful protest. A worker later discovers the connection between the Western and Chinese activists and dutifully reports it to the police, who extract a full confession from the Chinese activist. In the final panel, the Westerner unceremoniously escapes arrest and flees the country. Concluding with the caption "Banish foreign enemies and punish them severely," the comic emphasizes the need to ward off the destabilizing influences of Western NGOs and identifies these organizations as direct threats to national security.

This anti-foreign NGO campaign came on the heels of China's new Overseas NGO Law, which came into effect in January 2017. The 2017 Overseas NGO requires that all foreign NGOs be aligned with and monitored by a domestic organization, or Professional Supervisory Unit, and imposes strict requirements on the issue areas foreign NGOs can address, limiting them to education, technology, sports, poverty alleviation, and other non-contentious issues. The law was specifically designed to limit Western influence and insulate China's domestic NGO sector from foreign values, allowing the CCP to "better protect China from perceived external threats to its sovereignty and social stability" [@Shieh:2017].

China's anti-NGO law is part of a larger global trend of closing civic space in authoritarian regimes. Crackdowns and restrictions on NGOs have increased in frequency and severity. In 2015, Russia passed its Undesirable Organizations law, giving the government the ability to blacklist any foreign or international organization and force them to shut down. In May 2017, Egyptian president ʿAbd al-Fattāḥ al-Sīsī signed legislation that had sat in draft form since the 2011 uprising, imposing harsh jail sentences for any foreign NGO undertaking political activities or operating without paying a substantial registration fee. Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Myanmar, Cambodia, Bahrain, Hungary, and other authoritarian regimes have passed similar restrictive NGO laws in recent years. In its 2017 report on global civic space, CIVICUS found that only 3% of the world's population lives in open societies with minimal restrictions on associational activity, with the majority living in countries with obstructed or repressed civic space [@CIVICUS:2017].

Despite this increasingly closed space for global civil society, international NGOs (INGOs) continue to operate in authoritarian regimes, even in counties that have become more hostile. As of May 1, 2018, over one thousand foreign NGOs have gained either permanent or temporary official legal status in China under the provisions of the 2017 Foreign NGO law, including ten that work on labor issues—the subject of the national security cartoon [@Batke:2018]. More curiously, since the 1990s, China has strategically invited dozens of Western NGOs to set up offices locally, specifically to provide policy guidance and technical governing expertise [@Wheeler:2013]. Greenpeace—one of the most radical and outspoken INGOs in environmental advocacy—has offices in Beijing and has helped draft laws related to renewable energy and other environmental issues [@Teets:2014]. Though the 2017 law and the 2018 comic emphasize the national security risks of foreign NGOs, consulting with INGOs is a regular policy practice for the Chinese government. Despite their public pronouncements that NGOs are threats, authoritarian regimes around the world allow them and rely on them.

This presents a perplexing phenomenon. Authoritarian restrictions on domestic and international civil society have increased over the past decade, but authoritarian states continue to allow—and even invite—NGOs to work in their countries. Though the services and advocacy provided by NGOs can challenge the legitimacy and power of authoritarian regimes, the majority of autocratic states allow NGO activities, and NGOs in turn continue to work in these countries in spite of the heavy legal restrictions and attempts to limit their activities. This chapter examines the theories about and the experiences of domestic and international NGOs working in authoritarian countries. The review is premised on the theory of authoritarian institutions: dictators delegate political authority to democratic-appearing institutions in order to remain in power and maintain stability. After providing a brief overview of authoritarian institutionalism, I discuss how domestic and international NGOs fit into authoritarian stability-seeking calculus. I then look at the global crackdown on civil society in the context of authoritarian stability and explore the effects of the increasingly restricted civil society legal environment on NGOs in these countries. Finally, I conclude with suggestions for future research on NGOs and their relationship with and role in authoritarian regimes.


# Authoritarian institutions

Despite the popular image of all-powerful dictators who exert total control over their countries, authoritarians are often very precariously positioned and run the risk of regime collapse or overthrow. A growing literature in comparative politics argues that authoritarianism is a dynamic form of governance, with rulers engaging in constant legislative, constitutional, and institutional reforms as part of a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, opposition forces, international actors, activists, and social movements [@Stacher:2012, 31]. Autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010], and failure to do so can lead to regime collapse [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], and if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. 

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty and creating a veneer of popular consent [@Wintrobe:1990; @Gandhi:2006]. Autocrats carry out both strategies by navigating and manipulating the institutional landscape in their states, but interacting with external institutions is often fraught with risks. Though coercive institutions like the military and secret police forces are instrumental for maintaining state authority, finding the right balance of repression is difficult. Civilian authoritarian regimes often rely on strong militaries for legitimacy and coercion, but as regimes face economic hardship, popular unrest, or political instability, those militaries can emerge from their barracks to overthrow the failing state and instate new civilian authorities [@Cook:2007], as most recently seen in the military's interventions against both Hosni Mubarak and Mohamed Morsi in post-2011 Egypt. Internal police forces, deputized by autocrats to prevent coups against their regimes, pose a similar dilemma: secret police agencies that are too powerful could potentially stage their own coup against the autocrat, but forces that are too weak—and thus unable to revolt—are also unable to exercise coercive authority over the population and are thus ineffective at preventing popular coups [@Greitens:2016]. Striking the right balance of coercion is difficult and failure to do so can lead to regime collapse.

Because it is infeasible, costly, and difficult to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats have increasingly allowed for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition to manufacture popular consent and loyalty [@Brumberg:2002]. Today, dictatorships don "democratic garb" [@Brownlee:2007, 25] and mimic democratic institutions to ensure their survival, offset domestic pressure, and boost their international reputation [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. As seen in @fig:dictator-institutions, most authoritarian regimes hold democratic elections [@LevitskyWay:2010] and allow for multiparty legislatures [@Blaydes:2011], and many have empowered an independent judiciary [@GinsburgMoustafa:2008] and use independent central banks to set monetary policy [@Boylan:2001]. While these reforms—many of which are hallmarks of democratization—appear momentous to outsiders, these democratic-appearing institutions are designed to increase regime stability and longevity. For example, Egypt has held competitive parliamentary elections for decades, but not with the purpose of giving citizens representation in government. Instead, regimes have used elections to dole out patronage to politicians who proved their loyalty through competitive elections, thus mediating (or prolonging) distributional conflict between lower elites who could theoretically oppose the regime [@Blaydes:2011].

However, this devolution of control to democratic-appearing institutions—many of which can be actively opposed to the regime—creates a challenging competitive dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014]. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents. Political competition under authoritarianism is often "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. 

Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire. State-sponsored labor unions were some of the most active anti-government protesters in Egypt and Tunisia in the 2011 uprisings [@Beinin:2011], and opposition parties like the Muslim Brotherhood used competitive parliamentary elections to their advantage and regularly won large proportions of seats [@Wickham:2002]. These groups' political success allowed them to more effectively mobilize popular support against the regime and was a major factor in the Muslim Brotherhood's victory in the 2012 Egyptian presidential election. Dictators can permit nationalist anti-foreign protests to credibly signal their intentions during international crises and in effect use popular anger to increase regime stability in the international arena. However, these protests can spin out of control as opposition elites co-opt the protests, thus backfiring and destabilizing the regime [@Weiss:2013]. Initiatives to increase authoritarian legislative accountability to the public can also backfire—legislators in authoritarian regimes who are legally required to disclose their political activities and finances become less outspoken of the government and are less likely to be reelected or receive regime patronage, and are thus more likely to keep their activities hidden [@MaleskySchulerTran:2012]. 

Today, authoritarian adoption of ostensibly democratic institutions has become standard practice, and while elections, political reforms, protests, and legislative politics all appear to push countries towards democratization, autocrats have instead used these institutions to maintain stability. This strategy of institutional balancing carries significant risks, though, and can inadvertently challenge autocratic power. The key for authoritarian survival is thus striking the right balance of institutional independence and control.
